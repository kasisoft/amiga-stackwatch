Introduction
------------

  StackWatch is an utility which monitors the stack usage of a task. It
  helps you to find out whether a task has got enough stack or not. You
  can set the stacksize via "Icon/Information" for icons or via the command
  "stack" in the shell. With this tool you can find out if a program fails
  because it don't have enough stack.


Features
--------

  - completely fontsensitive while using "bgui.library"
  - is a commodity
  - localised (english (builtin), catalan, espanol, francais, srpski )
  - saves the maximum used in an entry (StackMon doesn't recognize this value)
  - during a list refresh only new tasks will be replaced or closed tasks
    will be removed


Use
---

  StackWatch requires AmigaOS 2.04 or higher and the "bgui.library" v37.
  The "locale.library" is also helpful. You can start it by a doubleclick
  on its icon or running it from the shell. Another way is to put the program
  in the WBStartup drawer so it will be started automatically.
  If the window of StackWatch is opened you will get a list of all tasks.
  Simply click on an entry and you will get all informations about it's
  stack usage. Monitoring is only active when the window is active.
  The program stops monitoring when the task was shutted down.
  Also you will get a message "Stack Overflow" if a program uses more
  stack than it has. You should notice that the system may crash in this
  case.

    CLI-USAGE:

      CX_POPUP/S      : if set the window will be opened at start
      CX_POPKEY       : set the hotkey (default: alt s)
      PS=PUBSCREEN/K  : set the name of the pubscreen to run on (default: Workbench)

    ToolTypes:

      CX_POPUP=YES|NO : see above
      CX_POPKEY=xxx   : see above
      PUBSCREEN=xxx   : see above


Compiler
--------

  StackWatch was written using Amiga E v3.3a. Note that E programs have their
  own stack managememt system, so StackWatch is only useful with these programs
  if you are using the included module "setstack()". You must call "setstack()"
  at the begin of your program and the displayed data will be correct.
  The sources of this program are included. The use of the call "setstack()"
  is demonstrated in these sources (it's very, very, very, very simple ).
