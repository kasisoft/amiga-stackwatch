  HISTORY
  -------

    1.0   :  First version.
    1.1   :  If the previous version wasn't able to create a commodity
             object, it has started without opening the gui. The gui
             wasn't reachable anymore. I've changed a method in the
             module "commodity.m" to fix that.
             ( 12-Oct-98 )
    1.2   :  Added new languages and done minor changings.
             ( 30-Jan-99 )
